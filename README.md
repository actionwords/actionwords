### Action Word Prediction for Neural Source Code summarization
This repository contains the code for action word prediction, a tool used for predicting only the action words of a subroutine comment. This project is aimed to demonstrate the importance of action words and how incorrect prediction of action words leads to poorer source code summary prediction overall.
